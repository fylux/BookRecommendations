# Book Recommendations
The goal of this project is to provide book recommendations in an useful way. For that purpose, the recommendations are integrated in a web application allowing users to explore books and authors, taking advantage of recommendations as well as by enhancing the information about the books with information extracted from Wikimedia. The project is composed of three main parts.
 - Scraping and grouping information about books.
 - Training of a Neural Network for book recommendations.
 - Exposing book related information in a web application.
 
## Book Scraping


## Recomendation System


## Web Application

## Technologies
This project is mostly based on Python, in particular for all the aspects related scraping and machine learning. However, the web application makes use of specific web technologies such as HTML and CSS. Regarding the libraries that have been used, for scraping relies mostly on [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) together with some parsing utilies. The recommendation system is built using [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). Finally, the web server is based on [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask).
